# About LABIB

LABIB (Lightweight AgentBased Intelligent Builder) is a focused, minimal agent SDK designed to get you productive fast:

- Small surface area, readable code
- Tooling first: easy to expose functions to models
- Works offline with a Mock backend, or online with OpenAI, or locally with Ollama
- Clear extension points for orchestration and external tools

## Why we built it
Most agent frameworks feel either too heavy or too toy. LABIB aims for a pragmatic middle: strong defaults, a tiny API, optional powerups.

## Principles
- Minimal API, maximum legibility
- No magic: explicit schemas, explicit steps
- Ship examples you can run in minutes

## Status
Alpha. Expect changes as we refine planner UX, add examples, and improve docs.
